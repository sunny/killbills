A Rails web app to remember the money you owe and who owes you money.
Write debts once, forget about them and even out with you friends when you want.

A bit like billmonk.com, only lighter, open source, HTML5, RESTFUL, …

Planned
-------

* Bills with two or more payers (Joe payed 5 €, I payed 15 €)
* Bills with different participations (Finn payed but he only had a 10 € salad)
* Recurrent bills
* Sharing debts between users of the same app
* Support for several currencies
* Support for other means of payments than money (he he.)
* JS+SVG charts and pies
* ARIA
* Adaptative stylesheets (@media)
* Internationalisation
