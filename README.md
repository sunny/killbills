A Rails web app to remember the money you owe and who owes you money.
Write debts once, forget about them and even out with you friends when you want.

A bit like billmonk.com, only lighter, open source, HTML5, RESTFUL, â€¦

Planned
-------

* Bills with more than one payer
* Bills with more than two participants
* Recurrent bills
* Support for several currencies
* Support for other means of payments than money (he he.)
* Sharing debts between users
* Sexy JS+SVG charts and pies
* Internationalisation, in French
* A CSS that doesn't break too much on IE (notice how it's not at the top of the list)
